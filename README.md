# MG-dom-jot
Dom-jot from star trek universe, HTML game.

Inspired by this post:
https://www.trekbbs.com/threads/how-do-you-think-dom-jot-is-played.130382/

look at the [resources](resources.md)
look at the [rules](rules.md)

Publicly accessible game will be build [here](https://hjalmarsnoep.github.io/MG-dom-jot/). Enjoy, fork, mod, all good, just leave any credits.
I am not actively making this game anymore, since there was a COMPLETE lack of interest.
I have moved on to Carrom, maybe, in due time, I'll use the physics of Carrom for this game..
